Description: Wrote a search engine from the ground up that is capable of handling tens 
of thousands of documents or Web pages, under harsh operational constraints and having 
a query response time under 300ms.

How to Run the Code:
1) run main.py through the command line "python main.py" 
    this creates the indexes
2) run app.py through the command line "python app.py"
    this runs the search interface
3) enter the localhost link that the command line gives you into your browser

4) type in your queries into the search bar and click the search button to get the results
